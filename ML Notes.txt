20-80 training machine

Supervised Learning

Classification - value in strings

Regression - use numeric


Unsupervised Learning

Clustering - grouping of data points (behavior)

Association - grouping based on rules

ML Steps:
1) Get Data
2) Clean and Preprocess Data
3) Shuffle (Random) Data
4) Split into Training/Test Data
5) Set Model Parameters - Learning Rate, 
                          Loss Function
                          Optimizer
6) Training the Model
7) Evaluate the Model
8) Use the Model

NA rule - number of NA values is minimum, it may
          be droped
        - number of NA is significant, use mean 
          value, bfill, ffill 

Cov - Covariance = dependent by percentage % 

Cor - Correlation = strenght of dependency by point
      (0.9, etc)
